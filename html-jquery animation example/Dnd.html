<p>One of the most classic games out there..</p>
<p>Dungeons and Dragons is highly recommended by all players and dungeons masters alike. This game has expanded into computer games and across boardgames nationally.  </p>
<p>However, nothing can beat the good old natstalgia of enjoying a good old fashioned D&D game. If you enjoy any fantasy at all I recommend you play a session of D&D immediately.  </p>
<p style="text-align:left">If you like video games you'll love Dungeons and Dragons! Think of any character you can imagine.. a fighter, sorcerer, theif, assasain, barbarian and you can be any of them in dnd. Dungeons and Dragons even expands into scifi universes... star wars, star trek, and even superheros. The game is relatively easy to understand and so simple all you need to play is a pen, paper, and dice. So get out there and dive into some Dungeons and Dragons with your friends! </p>
