<p>Warhammer is set in it's own special universe, called the 40k universe. This universe consists of many space alien races. The game, orginal table top game, consists largely of dice and minitures. The alien races range from half fungal orks, swamr insectiods, and zombie destroyer robots. Each race has their own stats for combat. Games can be objective based, anilahation, or even Zombie Boss based. If you enjoy rolling dice and constructing things this dice-roller may cost you a pretty penny but I can gaurantee you'll enjoy it.   </p>
